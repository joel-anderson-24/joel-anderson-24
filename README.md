## Hi there 👋
### My name is Joel and I'm a recently qualified Web Developer looking to expand my knowledge with continuous learning. 

🌱 I’m currently learning and cementing my knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript and React. I'm aspiring to learn C++ though because I'm an avid gamer and would love to create my own some day. 

⚡Fun fact: my first video game that I played was V8 Supercars on a PS2; it brought my two hobbies together - cars and games. 

👀 I'm looking forward to coding highs, lows and everything in between.
